"""Email dispatch with a tiny driver interface.

Drivers:
- `stdout` (default): logs the recipient + URL. Sufficient for v1, and the
  invitation API also surfaces the accept URL in the response so the admin
  can copy/paste while we're between providers.
- `resend`: posts to the Resend HTTP API when `RESEND_API_KEY` is set.
  Wired but not exercised in CI; flip the env in production.

A driver is chosen at call time (not boot time) so a tenant settings change
or env reload picks up immediately without an app restart.
